# BIDSifier

This should have one usable function: `BIDSify()`, that can be pointed at the `data` folder of the Intrepid 2a project and convert the behavioral files to BIDS format. The function will create or overwrite a folder called `Intrepid2a_BIDS` in the `data` folder. This code is built with the format used at the replication lab in Toronto in mind, so it may or may not work in Glasgow.
